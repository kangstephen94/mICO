# mICO
#### mICO is a mobile app designed to provide a platform for viewing and participating in initial coin offerings.

## Background and Overview
Initial coin offerings (ICOs) are evolving into an industry unto themselves.  As with any other growing business, you can tell this is happening when third parties intervene to create specialized services catered towards clients.  Here at mICO, we firmly believe that creating a mobile platform for viewing and participating in initial coin offerings will allow coin issuers and investors to focus more on the product and less on the details of the actual sale.

This problem decomposes into several areas of activity:

* List of upcoming and past ICOs
* Related news and social media outlets for each ICO
* Listings of crypto-related meetups and conferences

## Functionality and MVP

* Users will be able to signup/login and add specific ICOs to their favorites
* Users will be able to view an index of all the past and upcoming ICOs
* Users will be able to view an ICO page, and see all related content
* Users will be able to view an index of all crypto-related meetups and conferences local to their geographic location

## Bonus Features

* Allow users to rate ICOs
* Allow users to report ICOs
* Push notifications for when favorited ICOs start and end

## Technologies & Technical Challenges

Backend: NodeJS

Frontend: React Native, Redux
